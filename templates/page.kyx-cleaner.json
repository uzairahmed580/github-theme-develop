With that...they pick up some dirt, scuffs, or creases sometimes. That's when we get to work. When we say \"pro-clean\", we mean it. Below you will see the steps we take for every pair of shoes you see on our site. So when they arrive at your doorstep, you don't have to do anymore scrubbing, sneaker wiping, or hair brushing. Just slide them on and prepare for the compliments on your fresh KYX!"
